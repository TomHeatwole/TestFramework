README
- "Usage" explaining the 3 macros
- "Development" explaining the meta test framework and how to use it.

Main Library
- Parallel
- Probably use 2 vectors (name, functionPtr) instead of mapping them
- Pretty print?
- Assert functions?
- Allow multiple test files in same test run? Just need main to live outside of macros and have the END_FILE macro provide a way for tests to identify themselves to main. Perhaps adding an ID to a singleton test runner.


Meta Test Framework
- Better output on mismatch 
- Once we have parallel, we'll want smart comparison of outputs. Probably create a separate cpp binary to send both output strings to for comparison.
- We could also expose a non-parallel version, just for meta testing
