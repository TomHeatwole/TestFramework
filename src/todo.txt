README
- "Usage" explaining the 3 macros
- "Development" explaining the meta test framework and how to use it.

Main Library
- Probably use 2 vectors (name, functionPtr) instead of mapping them
- Pretty print?
- Assert functions
    - Allow string input for more detail
    - Also Expect functions?
    - Any way to capture line # or similar helpful info where failure occurred?
- Allow multiple test files in same test run? Just need main to live outside of macros and have the END_FILE macro provide a way for tests to identify themselves to main. Perhaps adding an ID to a singleton test runner.

Meta Test Framework
- Does everything it needs to for now :)
